This is a simple version of Hangman game.

Notes & Limitations:
--------------------
As of now, there are a few hardcoded values like master list of words (these are emoticons in this case!), 
number of guesses allowed, case sensitivity is not considered!

Future Scope:

The same program can be re-written using objects and its methods. 
Due to constraint of time, I have created a simple hangman game!
It could be made much mroe interesting and theme based and with level for difficulty and time based challenge!
